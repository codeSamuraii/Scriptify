# Scriptify
Scriptify let's you convert any file into a runnable Python script.

### Usage
To turn something into an executable code, use:
```
scriptify.py [source_file] [dest_file].py
```
_...and your script is ready!_

To restore the file, simply launch the script with Python.

### Features
This project is still in early developpement. While changing the file format and hidding it's content, the current output script does not provide any protection for your data or improvements in file size.

New features will be deployed *very* soon:
- File **compression** and signature
- Alternate container configurations: *minimum size* or *enhanced privacy*
- Data **encryption** w/ password
