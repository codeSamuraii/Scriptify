# Scriptify
Scriptify converts *any* file to a runnable Python script.

## Introduction
### Usage
Turn some file into a .py code with:
```
python3 scriptify.py [source_file] [dest_file].py
```

To turn it back, simply launch the created script.

### Features
This utility is in a very early stage of developpement.

The current output script doesn't provide any improvements in size or privacy, new features will be deployed *very* soon:
- **File compression** and signature
- Container options: "minimum size" and "privacy+"
- **Data encryption** with password
